# Tag: @static #

The static tag on classes will make all class members static. A static member is a method or property that can be accessed without the need of making an instance of the class. For example a constant or an utility method.

## Example of static method ##
```
/**
 * This method is static. 
 *
 * @method staticMethod
 * @static
 */
someClass.staticMethod = function() {
};
```
